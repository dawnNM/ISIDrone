# ISIDrone
ISIDrone is an ecommerce website where customers can buy drones by adding items to cart. Admin user can add, modify and delete items sold in the website. The admin user can also manage categories, orders and customers through the website. In this project I worked on the functionality for the admin user to either add, delete, view and modify Products and Orders.
